# finjnl - Finance Journal
___
## Motivation
This project was conceived as a result of the experience encountered by entering my daily spendings in a notebook.
Since the notebook could get lost, damaged or stolen and the information being stored was precious, I decided to move such information to the internet.
It features a mechanism where all these hassles have been eliminated by entering daily spendings into the app and being able to visualize it.
